# Kernel Combinations in Sparse Gaussian Processes for Audio Time Series Forecasting

## Data: Urban Sound 8K

We are using the **Urban Sound 8K** dataset, which contains 8,732 labeled audio clips (<= 4s) from 10 urban sound classes:

- Air Conditioner
- Car Horn
- Children Playing
- Dog Bark
- Drilling
- Engine Idling
- Gunshot
- Jackhammer
- Siren
- Street Music

### Key Features:
- **Number of samples**: 8,732
- **Duration**: ≤ 4 seconds per clip
- **Classes**: 10 urban sound categories
- **Sampling Rate**: 44.1 kHz
- **File format**: WAV
- **Cross-validation**: 10 folds

This dataset is ideal for machine learning and audio classification tasks, especially in noisy, urban environments.
